There are some loose ends in my backup program. I'll program the Run button later. First lets make sure the logic for displaying them and enabling them seems correct and that all relevant run buttons and checkboxes are displayed and fix:
- paste the long traceback for "_tkinter.TclError: invalid command name ".!notebook.!verticalscrolledframe.!scrollbar"
- paste the previous version of backupnowtray.py

I still get
- Paste the same error.
It still does it with the change to _stop_service in backupnowtray.py as you showed, and VerticalScrolledFrame as you showed and I implemented in backupnow/bnscrollableframe.py:
- Paste the WIP backupnow/bnscrollableframe.py.
